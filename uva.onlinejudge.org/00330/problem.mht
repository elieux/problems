<P>
     Madam Phoenix is moving to the southwest to open
a  ``Fun  In  The  Sun&quot;  store  selling  sunglasses,  sunscreen,  and  other
such items. She's  decided  to  employ  you  to write an inventory program
for her new store.  Here's how it will work.
<P>
<P>
Each ``activity&quot; your program is to process will appear as  a  separate
line  in   the   input   file.  The  end  of  the input is marked by a line
containing an asterisk in column one; no  other  activity  lines  will   be
so   marked.   Activity  lines begin with a lower-case keyword  identifying
the  action  to  be  performed.  The  names  of  the items in her inventory
are  case  sensitive,  and each contains no  more  than  ten  non-blank
characters.  All fields in the activity lines are separated by blanks,  and
Madam   Phoenix   guarantees   you   that  there  will  be no errors in the
input.  Here are the various types of activity lines  your  program  is  to
process.
<P>
<DL ><DT><STRONG><TT>new</TT> <EM>item-name item-cost item-selling-price</EM></STRONG>
<DD> 
<P>
     This line adds a new item (not previously  carried   in   the   store)
     to   the   potential   inventory.  The <EM>item-cost</EM>   and   
<EM>item-selling-price</EM>   
are   given    as    normal    dollar     amounts,     without
     the  dollar  sign.   That  is,  they  will contain one or more decimal
     digits,  a  decimal  point,  and  two  more decimal digits.  Note that
     this  activity  line doesn't actually result in a change in the inventory,  but is used in anticipation of adding units of  the  new   item
     to  the  store's  offerings.   <EM>item-cost</EM>  is what  Madam  Phoenix  pays
     for  each  unit  of  the  item,  and   <EM>item-selling-price</EM>    is    the
     price  for  which  she  sells the item.  There will be  no  more  than
     100  total  item-names  ever  included  in the list  of  items.  
<EM>item-cost</EM> and <EM>item-selling-price</EM> will never be larger than 100.00.
<P>
<DT><STRONG><TT>delete</TT> <EM>item-name</EM></STRONG>
<DD> 
<P>
     If an item isn't selling well, Madam Phoenix  can   remove   it   from
     the   inventory   by   including  this line in the program input.  All
     units of <EM>item-name</EM> in the inventory are written off as a loss.
<P>
<DT><STRONG><TT>buy</TT> <EM>item-name quantity</EM></STRONG>
<DD> 
<P>
     When  Madam  Phoenix  buys  some  units  (at  the  <EM>unit-cost</EM>,   previously   indicated)   of   an    <EM>item-name</EM> to offer for sale,  she'll
     indicate  that  with  one  of  these  lines  in  the  pregrain  input.
     <EM>quantity</EM>   indicates   the   number  of  units  she   purchased.   The
     quantity   she   purchases   will never be larger than 5000 at a time,
     but  the  number  of  units in  the  inventory  may  be  as  large  as
     10,000.
<P>
<DT><STRONG><TT>sell</TT> <EM>item-name quantity</EM></STRONG>
<DD> 
<P>
     When one or more units of an item are sold, that fact is  recorded  by
     placing  one  of  these  lines  in the   input.   <EM>quantity</EM>   indicates
     the   number   of   units   sold   (at   the   <EM>item-selling-price</EM> previously   indicated).  Obviously,  the  quantity  sold  cannot  exceed
     the  number   of   items   in stock.
<P>
<DT><STRONG><TT>report</TT></STRONG>
<DD> 
<P>
     This line in the input requests a report.  This is the only input line
     for   which   output   is   expected.   Your   program   will  display
     columns,   with   suitable   headings,    showing    item-name,    the
     buying price, the selling price, the number of units in the inventory,
     and the  value  of  the  units  in  the inventory (that is,  the  product  of  the  number  of  units  in  the  inventory  and  the  buying
     price).  The lines in the report  should  be  sorted  in  alphabetical
     order   on  item  name.  Following  the  last  item the total value of
     all units in the inventory should be displayed.  Then finally, a  line
     should   appear  showing  the  total  profit since the last report was
     issued.  Profit is defined as total sales,   less   the  cost  of  the
     items  sold,  less  the  cost of items  written  off  (by  the  
<TT>delete</TT>
     activity). Print a blank line after every report. The  sample output shown  illustrates  the  desired   format   for  the  report.  All  numbers  in  the  report  must naturally
     be  exact.
