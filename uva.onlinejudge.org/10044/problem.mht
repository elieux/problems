Background</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The Hungarian Paul Erd&#246;s (1913-1996, speak as ``Ar-dish'') not only was one
of the strangest mathematicians of the 20th century, he was also one of the
most famous. He kept on publishing widely circulated papers up to a very high
age and every mathematician having the honor of being a
co-author to Erd&#246;s is well respected.

<P>
Not everybody got the chance to co-author a paper with Erd&#246;s, so many people
were content if they managed to publish a paper with somebody who had
published a scientific paper with Erd&#246;s. This gave rise to the 
so-called <EM>Erd&#246;s numbers</EM>. 
An author who has jointly published with Erd&#246;s had Erd&#246;s
number 1. An author who had not published with Erd&#246;s but with somebody with
Erd&#246;s number 1 obtained Erd&#246;s number 2, and so on.

Problem</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
Today, nearly everybody wants to know which Erd&#246;s number he or she
has. Your task is to write a program which computes Erd&#246;s numbers
for a given set of scientists.

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001003000000000000000">
Input</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
The first line of the input contains the number of scenarios.

<P>
The input for each scenario consists of a paper database and a list of names. 
It begins with the line

<P>

<I>P N</I>

<P>
where <I>P</I> and <I>N</I> are  natural numbers. Following this line are
<I>P</I> lines containing descriptions of papers (this is the paper database). A
paper appears on a line by itself and is specified in the following way: 
<PRE>
Smith, M.N., Martin, G., Erdos, P.: Newtonian forms of prime factors matrices
</PRE>
Note that umlauts like `&#246;' are simply written as `o'. After the <I>P</I> papers
follow <I>N</I> lines with names. Such a name line has the following format:
<PRE>
Martin, G.
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001004000000000000000">
Output</A>&nbsp;</FONT>
</H2>
For every scenario you are to print a line containing a string 
``<TT>Scenario </TT><I>i</I>" (where <I>i</I> is the number of the scenario) and
the author names together with their Erd&#246;s number of all authors in the 
list of names. The authors should appear in the same order as they appear 
in the list of names.
The Erd&#246;s number is based on the papers in the paper database of this
scenario. Authors which do not have any relation to Erd&#246;s via the papers
in the database have Erd&#246;s number ``<TT>infinity</TT>".
