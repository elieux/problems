<H2>Problem D: ShellSort </H2>

<EM>
He made each turtle stand on another one's back<BR>
And he piled them all up in a nine-turtle stack.<BR>
And then Yertle climbed up. He sat down on the pile.<BR>
What a wonderful view! He could see 'most a mile!
</EM>


<H3>The Problem</H3>
<P>

King Yertle wishes to rearrange his turtle throne to place his highest-ranking
nobles and closest advisors nearer to the top.
A single operation is available to change the order of the turtles in the
stack: a turtle can crawl out of its position in the stack and climb up over
the other turtles to sit on the top.

</P><P>

Given an original ordering of a turtle stack and a required ordering for
the same turtle stack, your job is to determine a minimal sequence of
operations that rearranges the original stack into the required stack.

</P><P>

The first line of the input consists of a single integer <EM> K </EM>
giving the number of test cases.
Each test case consist on an integer <EM> n </EM> giving the number of
turtles in the stack.
The next <EM> n </EM> lines specify the original ordering of the turtle stack.
Each of the lines contains the name of a turtle, starting with the turtle on
the top of the stack and working down to the turtle at the bottom of the stack.
Turtles have unique names, each of which is a string of no more than eighty
characters drawn from a character set consisting of the alphanumeric
characters, the space character and the period (`.').
The next <EM> n </EM> lines in the input gives the desired ordering of the
stack, once again by naming turtles from top to bottom.
Each test case consists of exactly 2<EM>n</EM>+1 lines in total.
The number of turtles (<EM>n</EM>) will be less than or equal to two hundred.

</P><P>
For each test case,
the output consists of a sequence of turtle names, one per line, indicating the
order in which turtles are to leave their positions in the stack and crawl
to the top.
This sequence of operations should transform the original stack into the
required stack and should be as short as possible.
If more than one solution of shortest length is possible, any of the
solutions may be reported.
Print a blank line after each test case.
