\section*{\fontsize{12}{25}Calculator}
Ian needs to do his math homework, but his calculator's broken and he doesn't want to do all the computations by himself. Can you make a program to help him?

\section*{Input}

Fortunately, your program doesn't have to do derivatives nor binomial coefficients as Ian will only need to compute simple expressions. First line of the input contains number $N$ ($\leq 100000$). Each of $N$ following lines of the input will be in the form "A O B", where A and B are non-negative integers ($\leq 10000000$) and O is one of the following operators: "*", "+", "-". There is at least one space between both A and O, and O and B.

\section*{Output}

For each of the N input expressions, output the result of the expression. Each result must be on its own line.

\section*{Sample input}
\begin{verbatim}
3
234 + 432
6 * 7
512 * 2
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Sample Output}
\begin{verbatim}
666
42
1024
\end{verbatim}
